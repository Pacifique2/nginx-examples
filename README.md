# Nginx examples
The goal is this project is to study the nginx software and its different use cases with real world projects' examples.
Up to now, I just deployed and tested a nginx web server on Ms Azure cloud. 
Next we will test how to use it fo website hosting, as a load balancer and as well as a reverse proxy.
